# Project Guidelines for Claude

## User Preferences

- **Do things the right way**: Always prefer the correct/proper approach over shortcuts, even if it takes more effort. Help the user learn the process.
- **Feature branch workflow**: Always use feature branches for new work. Never commit directly to main.
- **Code review before merge**: All changes should go through a PR and code review before merging to main.

## Git Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from main for any new work
2. Make commits on the feature branch
3. Push the branch and create a PR
4. Review the PR (use code-review skill)
5. Merge only after review passes
